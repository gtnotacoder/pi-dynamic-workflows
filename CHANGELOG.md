# Changelog

All notable changes to **`pi-dynamic-workflows-oc-style`** — originally derived from
[`@quintinshaw/pi-dynamic-workflows`](https://github.com/QuintinShaw/pi-dynamic-workflows) (MIT).
Only changes from upstream are listed here; upstream history is preserved in git.
See [PROVENANCE.md](./PROVENANCE.md) for the derivation history and upstream relationship.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add optional machine-local `routingNotes` to `model-tiers.json`; the workflow tool injects them alongside the concrete tier mapping so model-authored workflows can apply operator-specific specialization.
- Add non-blocking tier diagnostics for missing or duplicate `small`/`medium`/`big` mappings. `/workflows-models` surfaces duplicate mappings that would make an escalation retry the same model.

### Fixed

- Distinguish GPT-5.6 public-API context (`1.05M`) from the ChatGPT Codex route (`372k`). Near-boundary probes with compaction disabled confirmed exact retrieval around 370k and `context_length_exceeded` around 375k for Sol, Terra, and Luna; Codex registry entries remain at 372k so compaction and occupancy telemetry do not overrun the provider.
- Snapshot model-tier configuration once per run and include the concrete routed model in journal identities. Changing a tier mapping or main-model route now invalidates the affected resume suffix instead of replaying output from the previous model.

### Documentation

- Replace the stale GPT-5.5-era routing research note with current local-first guidance for GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna, GLM-5.2, Claude Fable 5/Opus 4.8, Gemini 3.5 Flash, and local Qwen. GPT-5.5 is retained only as a temporary benchmark/control route.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-07-05

Naming cleanup, FastContext removal, context documentation, and per-agent skills allowlist.

### ⚠️ Breaking

- Rename the `/ultracode` command to `/maxeffort` (registered maximal-effort command in `src/effort-command.ts`, user-facing strings, README commands table, tests). The `EffortLevel` "ultra" tier value is unchanged — that is `/effort`, not the command name.

### Removed

- FastContext integration is removed: the upstream exploration tool was discontinued. The Scout phase now uses the existing codegraph exploration stack (`codegraph_explore`/`codegraph_context`/`codegraph_search`/`codegraph_files`, `ffgrep`/`fffind`, targeted `ctx_read`/`read_symbol`, `lsp_navigation`), and the scout `agentType` is now `code-scout`. The discontinued tool's read-only allowlist entries, transient path (`.gitignore`, Biome excludes, finalization-ignore guidance), and fixture wording are all retired.

### Added

- Per-agent **skills allowlist**: `agent()` accepts `skills: ["name", ...]` to load only the named skills for that subagent, regardless of `inheritSkills`/`contextMode`. An empty array is a **fence** (zero skills); unknown names warn and are skipped; the run never fails. Precedence: `skills` > `inheritSkills`/`contextMode`. The allowlist is folded into the resume call-hash so changing it busts the cached result. Pure helper `filterSkillsByName` is exported from `src/context-mode.ts` for direct unit testing. Documented in README and `docs/context-modes.md`.
- `docs/context-toolchain.md` (new): documents the context-handling companions — the Autocompactor (modes, pre-compaction accounting, durable-artifact preservation, `vcc_recall` scopes), Hindsight memory (`retain`/`recall`/`reflect`, `memory_gardener` saved workflow), and how the three tiers (within-turn / across-compaction / across-restarts) compose.
- Authoring payload rule added to `docs/prompt-guidance-style.md` ("Verdicts, not payloads"): the agent-result channel carries verdicts, not payloads; anything over ~10KB goes to a file and the ack is `{ok, path, count}`.
- `CONTEXT.md` (new, repo root): a pure ubiquitous-language glossary — one term, one crisp definition each (harness, herdr, conductor, issue delivery, closed-loop delivery, hopper, clean-skip, prototype mode, scout firewall, model tiers, worktree isolation, workflow lock, agent-result channel, effort mode, gardener, autocompactor, hindsight, durable artifact, and more). No implementation details.

### Acknowledgements

- The glossary practice and skill-design principles adopted this release follow Matt Pocock's skills repo ([https://github.com/mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills)).

### Verification

- `npm test` passes (1398 tests / 0 fail) — no worse than the 0.2.1 baseline (1385/0).
- Exhaustive greps across the repo (excluding this CHANGELOG's history) return **zero** hits for both `ultracode` and `fastcontext` (case-insensitive).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-02

First milestone release since 0.1.7 — consolidates ~20 merged PRs: the harness-agnostic broker (`harness_type`/`harness_config`), run-level worktree isolation, host-shared ModelRegistry for subagents, the upstream-provenance/docs deep-clean, and the `.fugu`/`.fastcontext` vocabulary retirement. (Changelog was behind since 0.1.3; 0.1.4–0.1.7 shipped without sections — this entry folds in everything since.)

### Removed

- Purge `.fugu/` and `.fastcontext/` transient-path vocabulary entirely (no more "legacy" mentions): `TRANSIENT_IGNORE_PREFIXES` is now `['.issue-delivery/']` only, issue-delivery prompts/transient lists mention only `.issue-delivery/`, README scrubbed. **Behavior change:** `.fugu/` is fully retired — also removed from `.gitignore` and Biome excludes, so leftover `.fugu/` debris is visible to git and blocks finalization with an actionable path list (covered by a new test). `.fastcontext/` remains git-ignored/lint-excluded as defensive hygiene for third-party FastContext tool output (still written by the Scout until #105) but appears in no workflow vocabulary. (#104)

- Remove `docs/issues.md` (stale local issue index — GitHub is canonical) and `docs/plans/` (plans for closed issues #64/#82/#87; content preserved in their issues/PRs). Both were stale-planning-artifact context poison of the same class as the upstream roadmap removed in #97. (#102)

- Remove `docs/2.0-roadmap.md` — a stale pre-fork upstream planning artifact (upstream implemented and deleted it in their own tree); it misled planning sessions into treating upstream's completed backlog as ours. (#97)
- Remove `docs/fugu-test.md`, the naming-migration compatibility pointer; `docs/issue-delivery-smoke-test.md` is the canonical page. (#97)

### Changed

- Docs staleness deep-clean (#102): every `docs/*.md` now opens with a status banner (research note vs reference vs historical/roadmap) so agents don't consume point-in-time research as current spec; README descriptor-schema table documents the shipped `triggerRules`, `description`, `worktreeRequired`, and `engine.min` fields (loader-skip + clean-skip semantics); README command table gains `/workflow-telemetry-report`; "Our patches" reframed as historical initial-derivation edits pointing at this CHANGELOG; hardcoded test-count dropped from the README status line (it went stale within hours — the gate itself is the claim).
- Reposition PROVENANCE/README/CHANGELOG upstream language: the projects have diverged and upstream is now a read-only idea source (reviewed ~quarterly, concepts ported as issues — never diffs). Records the 2026-07-02 review of upstream v2.10.0 (one portable fix → #98). Stale test counts refreshed. (#97)

### Added

- Add the workflow authoring global `dag([{ id, dependsOn?, run }])` for dependency-aware fan-out. It runs dependency-ready nodes in deterministic waves for resume-safe `agent()` call ordering, validates duplicate/missing/cyclic dependencies, cascade-skips dependents of failed nodes, and lets independent branches continue.
- Add a run-level `loopGuard` option that detects repeated identical `agent()` calls. The default is warn-only; `{ action: "abort" }` hard-stops runaway workflow loops.
- `WorkflowSettings.defaultWorkflowTimeoutMs` (number | null) for a configurable run-wide wall-clock timeout default, normalized like `defaultAgentTimeoutMs` (`null` disables, positive finite numbers are retained, invalid/zero/negative values are dropped, absent keeps the runtime constant).
- Thread the settings default through `WorkflowManager` (`WorkflowManagerOptions.defaultWorkflowTimeoutMs`), the `workflow` tool, saved slash-command execution, and `/workflows resume`. Effective timeout precedence per run: `exec.workflowTimeoutMs` → the run's captured/persisted value → the manager/settings default → `undefined` (runtime `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_TIMEOUT_MS`). The effective value is persisted so resumed runs keep their original explicit/settings timeout; old persisted runs without the field keep using the runtime constant. (Closes #10, part 1)

## [0.1.3] — 2026-06-22

### Added

- Add `/adversarial-review --evidence` as an opt-in source-ledger mode on the existing command.
- Support no-key evidence components: `web_fetch`, GitHub URLs/files via `web_fetch`, and optional best-effort `web_search` discovery.
- Add `/adversarial-review` options for reviewer count and agreement threshold.
- Let `WorkflowManager` receive per-run tool sets so background/managed slash workflows can inject evidence tools only when requested.

### Fixed

- Make built-in and saved slash workflows start through the shared `WorkflowManager` so `/workflows`, the task panel, transcripts, and final result delivery stay live instead of appearing frozen.

### Documentation

- Document `/adversarial-review` flags, evidence components, aliases, and release status.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-06-22

### Security / hardening

- Document the trusted-code workflow security model: Node `vm` is a determinism realm, not a sandbox for untrusted workflow scripts.
- Add workflow run ID validation before persistence, lease, resume, delete, transcript, and run-state path joins.
- Include resolved context primitives in resume journal hashes so `legacy` output cannot replay under `focused` or a changed project mode.
- Add an async workflow wall-clock timeout for suspended scripts and make per-agent timeouts abort and settle before limiter/worktree release.
- Make `/code-review` use read-only tools and host-computed structured git argv/patch data instead of model-produced command strings.
- Ship security and provenance docs in the npm package.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Require the exact `workflow-run` editor trigger phrase for rainbow/workflows mode; ordinary `workflow` / `workflows` text no longer auto-arms workflow execution.
- Keep the model-facing tool name as `workflow` for compatibility.
- Update the workflows-mode forcing prompt to require a concise final synthesis after the `workflow` tool returns, preventing blank final assistant messages.
- Make worktree tests independent of local git commit hooks in temporary repositories.

### Documentation

- Add `docs/issues.md` as the local issue tracker index for migrated/cross-repo issues.
- Update README command/help text and status to 827/827 tests.

## [0.1.0] — first standalone release (derived from upstream v2.7.0)

Originally derived from `@quintinshaw/pi-dynamic-workflows` v2.6.0 (`622f6df`),
aligned to upstream v2.7.0. All changes below are on top of that.

### Workflow engine (EDITs 1–2)

- Cap `parallel()` / `pipeline()` fan-out at 4096 items. (`9a65cb4`)
- Cap workflow script body at 524,288 bytes and `runInContext` timeout at 30,000 ms. (`b41d89a`)

### Built-in `code-review` (EDIT 4 + routing)

- Add built-in `/code-review` workflow with an effort-parameterized topology (scope → find → verify → sweep → synthesize). (`5f720d5`)
- Add the code-review angle prompts (correctness/cleanup angles, verdict ladder). (`ff604c9`)
- Run all review agents on the `big` tier (GPT/Codex); coding workers stay on `small` (local Qwen). (`9993056`, superseding `d7ee84a`)

### Task panel & notifications (EDITs 3, 5, 6 + hardening)

- Add per-subagent transcript logging (`ManagedRun.transcriptDir`) and `<task-notification>` XML delivery. (`b8ae522`)
- Polish the live progress panel and add the Claude concurrency floor. (`719bd27`)
- Surface an errored subagent's error message in the live panel. (`b65872c`)
- Harden errored-subagent error surfacing — 5 confirmed bugs fixed (code-point-safe truncation, first-line extraction, whitespace-only errors, shared `agentErrorText()` helper). (`3f22868`)
- Add a narrow-width regression test for the error-reason truncation fix. (`bd658a7`)
- Make chat the canonical workflow surface: `<recovery>` links transcript dir + run-state JSON with `file://` URIs on failure; `<usage><tool_uses>` now real (from agent history). (`f1b4cc8`)
- Address the Codex `/code-review` findings on the UI-fix commit. (`b3a981c`)

### Progress dedup (chat + panel)

- Suppress redundant foreground chat streaming when a UI task panel is showing live progress. (`5711204`)
- Address all 10 Codex `/code-review` findings: robust suppression gated on `manager.hasTaskPanel` (no-panel hosts keep the chat stream), guard the per-event recompute for inert displays, `ManagedRun.runStatePath` decoupled from transcript persistence, shared `runStateJsonPath` helper, cheap `hasActiveRuns()` for the idle timer. (`5fda282`)

### Context modes (EDIT 7 — feature)

- Add per-subagent context governance: `inheritProjectContext` / `systemPromptMode` (`append`|`replace`) / `inheritSkills`, selected via named modes or per-field overrides, the `/modes` command, and `--mode` on the bundled commands. (`50fe3e9`)
- **Redesign around main-agent rule leakage (OpenCode model).** Add the `inheritMainRules` primitive governing the main-agent append channel (`.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md`) — verified that subagents previously inherited it, leaking orchestration-only rules. New default mode **`focused`** keeps shared `AGENTS.md` + skills but blocks the main-rules channel (`appendSystemPrompt:[]`); `legacy` (alias `inherit`) restores full inheritance byte-identically. Modes renamed (`focused`/`isolated`/`scoped`/`legacy`); built-in names reserved from project overrides. 825/825 unit tests.

### Documentation

- Document context modes in the README + `docs/context-modes.md` (the four prompt channels, the main-rules model, verified behavior). (EDIT 7)
- Add PROVENANCE + fork banner. (`dbece49`)
- Note v2.7.0 upstream tracking and the edit-branch forward-merge. (`6d9116d`)
- Simplify the README to a fork pointer and consolidate edits into `main`. (`799aeb9`)
- Document commands, the authoring API, and model routing. (`2d34e34`)

### Merges (branch consolidation)

- `94649f0` — merge `origin/main` into `edit2/script-size-timeout-cap`.
- `0b53731` — merge `edit2/script-size-timeout-cap` into `main`.
